# String-Reversal
This JavaScript code prompts the user to enter a string, then defines a function called 'inverser' which takes a string 'ch' as input. Inside the function, the string is split into an array of characters, reversed, and then joined back into a string. 
The reversed string is then returned. Finally, the reversed string is displayed using 'document.write'. This script demonstrates how to reverse a string in JavaScript.
